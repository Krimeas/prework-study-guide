# prework-study-guide
A study guide for prework bootcmap


## Description

I wanted to learn to code so that I can transition into a new career; so I created this PreWork Study Guide to help easily recall notes on JavaScript, Git, CSS, and HTML.  In doing so i learned abotu each of them and how they worked while building the foundations of the study guide and layering on each component.  Though work stresses made it a bit hectic to manage during the weekdays, I pushed through each module on the weekends to get to full deplaoyment.
